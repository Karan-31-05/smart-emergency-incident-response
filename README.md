# 🚨 Smart Emergency Incident Response System

### Multi-Agent AI + RAG for Safety-Aware Emergency Response Coordination

An agentic AI system designed to analyze emergency incident reports, extract critical information, retrieve relevant procedures, validate safety and evidence, and generate a coordinated response plan with **human approval before deployment**.

The system combines **LangGraph, Groq, RAG, Chroma, and Streamlit** into a multi-stage emergency response workflow.

## 📦 Submission Deliverables

This repository contains the complete application source code and the two requested Markdown artifacts:

1. [Application generation prompt](application_prompt.md) - reusable prompt for regenerating or extending the application.
2. [Capstone deliverables](deliverables.md) - architecture diagram, agent workflow design, deployment strategy, security model, monitoring dashboard design, and source inventory.
3. Complete source code - all application modules are included in the repository root.

The deliverables document distinguishes the current prototype behavior from production recommendations.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflow

### 1. Incident Agent

Analyzes the raw incident report and extracts important information such as:

* Incident type
* Location
* Severity
* People at risk
* Other relevant incident details

The extracted information becomes shared state for the downstream agents.

---

### 2. Map Agent

Processes the incident location and attempts to resolve it safely.

If geocoding fails, the system uses **safe default coordinates** instead of allowing the workflow to fail.

---

### 3. Knowledge RAG Agent

Retrieves relevant emergency procedures from the local knowledge base.

The system uses:

* **Chroma** for vector storage
* Local procedure documents
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

If retrieval fails, the agent falls back to a generic procedure so the workflow can continue.

Procedure documents are stored under:

```text
data/procedures/
```

The current clone does not include that directory. When it is unavailable, the agent uses its documented generic-procedure fallback so the workflow can still complete.

---

### 4. Resource Agent

Evaluates available response resources.

The current implementation uses a **local resource simulation** and does not depend on external dispatch systems.

---

### 5. Decision Agent

Combines the information collected from the previous stages and produces the initial response decision.

The decision considers:

* Incident information
* Location information
* Retrieved procedures
* Available resources

---

### 6. Safety Checker

Validates the proposed response from a safety perspective.

Instead of crashing the entire workflow when an issue is detected, the Safety Checker **flags the issue** so that it can be reviewed.

---

### 7. Evidence Verifier

Checks whether the generated decision is supported by the available incident evidence.

The UI exposes:

* Evidence verification status
* Evidence summary
* Unsupported claims

---

### 8. Human Review

Human oversight is integrated into the final response workflow.

The Streamlit interface provides:

```text
Approval Status
├── pending
├── approved
└── rejected
```

Reviewers can also provide:

```text
Review Comments
```

#### Pending

The plan requires additional review and is not authorized for deployment.

#### Approved

The plan has received human authorization and is marked as authorized for deployment.

#### Rejected

The plan has been rejected and should be revised or reviewed again.

Rejected plans are expected to include review comments, and the UI warns when comments are missing.

---

## 📋 Final Action Plan

After the workflow completes, the system generates a final action plan.

The plan includes a clear authorization status indicating whether the response is authorized for deployment.

The action plan can be downloaded directly from the Streamlit interface as a `.txt` file.

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard

The project includes a Streamlit web interface for interacting with the system.

### Incident Input

Users can paste an emergency incident report directly into the application.

### Human Review Sidebar

The sidebar provides:

* Approval status
* Review comments
* Review run count
* Clear history button

### Verification Dashboard

After execution, the UI displays:

* 🛡️ Safety validation status
* 🔎 Evidence verification status
* 👤 Human approval status
* 📚 Evidence summary
* ⚠️ Unsupported claims
* 💬 Human review comments

### Agent Execution Trace

The application can display the execution trace produced by the workflow.

### Additional Details

The UI can expose:

* Location
* Incident type
* Severity
* People at risk
* Map information
* Resources
* Safety status
* Evidence status
* Approval status
* Review comments

---

## 📊 Review History

The application maintains a session-level review history.

Each run records:

| Field           | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Timestamp       | Time of the review               |
| Location        | Incident location                |
| Incident Type   | Type of emergency                |
| Severity        | Incident severity                |
| People at Risk  | Number/details of people at risk |
| Safety Check    | Safety validation result         |
| Evidence Check  | Evidence verification result     |
| Approval Status | Human authorization status       |
| Review Comments | Human reviewer notes             |

The interface displays the most recent review sessions and allows the history to be exported as a `.csv` file.

The history can also be cleared from the sidebar.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Open the project folder

```powershell
cd <path-to>\smart-emergency-incident-response
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

python -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

For PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run:

## 🧪 Example Incident

You can test the system using:

```text
A large fire broke out on the third floor of a residential
building downtown. About 8 people are trapped in their
apartments and can't get out. Heavy smoke is spreading.
```

The system processes the incident through:

```text
Incident Analysis
        ↓
Location Resolution
        ↓
Procedure Retrieval
        ↓
Resource Assessment
        ↓
Initial Decision
        ↓
Safety Validation
        ↓
Evidence Verification
        ↓
Human Approval
        ↓
Final Action Plan
```

---

## 🛡️ Reliability & Safety

The system includes multiple fallback mechanisms.

### Map Agent

If geocoding fails:

```text
Geocoding Failure
       ↓
Safe Default Coordinates
```

### Knowledge RAG

If procedure retrieval fails:

```text
Retrieval Failure
       ↓
Generic Procedure Fallback
```

### Resource Agent

The current implementation does not depend on external dispatch systems.

### Safety Checker

Safety problems are flagged instead of causing the entire workflow to crash.

### Human Approval

The final plan is subject to human approval before deployment authorization.

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 🤖 Agentic AI

The system uses specialized agents for different stages of the incident response workflow instead of relying on a single LLM call.

### 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Relevant emergency procedures are retrieved from a local knowledge base before generating the response.

### 🛡️ Safety Validation

The generated response passes through a dedicated safety validation stage.

### 🔎 Evidence Verification

The system checks whether the generated decision is supported by the available evidence.

### 👤 Human-in-the-Loop

Human authorization is explicitly represented in the workflow before deployment.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

Potential future extensions include:

* 🔌 Connect the Resource Agent to a real dispatch API
* 📚 Add more emergency procedure documents
* ⚡ Display agent execution traces live
* 👤 Expand the human-in-the-loop review process
* 🌐 Integrate real-time emergency resources
* 🗺️ Improve map and location integration
* 📊 Add analytics for historical incident reviews
* 🔎 Improve evidence retrieval and verification
* 🧠 Improve multi-agent coordination
* 🔐 Add stronger authentication and authorization for reviewers

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for **AI research, development, education, and demonstration purposes**.

It is **not a replacement for trained emergency personnel, official emergency procedures, or real-world emergency dispatch systems**.

Real-world deployment would require extensive validation, reliable data sources, security controls, human oversight, and integration with authorized emergency infrastructure.
